# Freight

A package manager that aims to not reinvent the wheel. There are so many cool
wheels out there already? Isn't it time someone put them on a car. Borrows ideas
from nix but removes all the over complication of that and just gives you a list
of packages and services to enable. Now it is just 'kinda' reliable.
