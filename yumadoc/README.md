# Yumadoc

A proc-macro that allows you to annotate specific lines of code with
documentation. When you write a doc comment within code it will take that
comment and place the line of code directly bellow it in a doc comment above
the function. Useful to create documentation for devolopers when working on
bin projects where the only doc consumer is another devoloper.
